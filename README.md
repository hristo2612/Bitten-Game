# Bitten.

My first real project ever made back in 2016 ( sadly i don't have the source code, but I sure have the Game on the App Store! )
The Game was made with <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> ( A language promoting visual arts and visual literacy ) & Android Studio ( For Ads & Some other Google Configurations )

<h2>Check the game on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=processing.test.game_pre_release_&hl=en&gl=US">Google Play</a></h2>
